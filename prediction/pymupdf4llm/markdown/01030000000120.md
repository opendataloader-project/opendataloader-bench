Sickle cell hemoglobin and normal hemoglobin differ in only a single amino acid out of more than 100

amino acids in the complete hemoglobin protein. This difference in a single amino acid results in the

different properties of sickle cell hemoglobin compared to normal hemoglobin.


Hemoglobin is carried inside red blood cells. Normal hemoglobin dissolves in the watery cytosol of red

blood cells. Sickle cell hemoglobin is less soluble in the cytosol because:


  - Valine (Val) is much less water-soluble than glutamic acid (Glu).

  - Amino acid 6 is in a crucial location on the outer surface of the hemoglobin protein.
The chart on the next page shows how the lower solubility of sickle cell hemoglobin results in the

symptoms of sickle cell anemia.
