the jet velocity can be assumed to remain constant. Therefore, the horizontal distance traveled by jet
(x) in time (t) is equal to:


The vertical component of the trajectory of the jet will have a constant acceleration downward due to
the force of gravity. Therefore, at any time, t, the y-position of the jet may be calculated as:


Rearranging Equation (8) gives:


Substitution of t and _v_ from Equations 9 and 2 into Equation 7 results in:


Equations (10) can be rearranged to find _C_ v:


Therefore, for steady flow conditions (i.e., constant h in the head tank), the value of _C_ v can be
determined from the x, y coordinates of the jet trajectory. A graph of _x_ plotted against will have
a slope of 2 _C_ v _._


**7.2. DETERMINATION OF THE COEFFICIENT OF DISCHARGE**


If _C_ d is assumed to be constant, then a graph of _Q_ plotted against (Equation 6) will be linear, and
the slope of this graph will be:
