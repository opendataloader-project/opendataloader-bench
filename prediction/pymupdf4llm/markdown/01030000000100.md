On a final note, Yoeli et al. provide evidence that indirect reciprocity among _Homo sapiens_ is unique
to public goods. Their hypothesis is that choosing not to participate in a demand response program
should carry the threat of social sanctions only if participation is considered to be for the public good.
To test their hypothesis, the authors solicited an additional 1,000 customers with exactly the same
treatments as described above, except that the informational materials the customers received ahead
of time to entice them to participate in the demand response program were stripped of any language
