As for the normal phase, the choice will, to start with, be the simplest possible
one: each path is either possible or not, corresponding to the probability weights 1
and 0. During the extreme phases, this assumption is no longer reasonable. Again
the model will be extremely simplified, but still it is based on physical intuition and,
most importantly, completely time symmetric. Assume that the only types of edges
having a non-neglectable chance of occurring during the extreme phase

are of the following two kinds: The first scenario is that the universe

passes through the extreme phase into a state of zero entropy. The other scenario is
that it passes into a state with high entropy (equal to 2m). Universes of one of these
two types will be given the (un-normalized) probability 1 or p, respectively. Here
p > 0 should be thought of as a very small number, at least when the size of the
model becomes large. During the other extreme phase m, m
, near the Big
Crunch, we make the completely symmetric assumption.

Remark 3. These assumptions may perhaps seem somewhat arbitrary. And to a
certain extent, this may be so. However, they do represent the following viewpoint
of what may happen at the full cosmological scale: we may think of the Big Bang and
the Big Crunch as states of complete order with zero volume and entropy. Such
states can very well be metastable, very much like an oversaturated gas at a tem-
perature below the point of condensation. If no disturbance takes place, such meta-
stable states can very well continue to exist for a substantial period of time. In
particular, a low-entropy state can have a very good chance of surviving the intense
but extremely short extreme phase. On the other hand, if a sufficiently large dis-
turbance occurs, then the metastable state may almost immediately decay into a
very disordered state of high entropy.

It is not my intension to further argue in favor of this viewpoint here. The main
thing in this chapter is to show that completely symmetric boundary conditions at
the endpoints may give rise to a broken time symmetry.

The multiverse now splits up into four different kinds of paths:

• LL: The entropy is low (=0) at both ends (

m and m).

�

• LH: The entropy is 0 at

m and 2m at m.

�

• HL: The entropy is 2m at

m and 0 at m.

�

• HH: The entropy is high (

2m) at both ends (

m and m).

If we now denote by NLL, NLH, NHL and NHH the number of paths of the
indicated kinds, then with the above assumptions we also get the corresponding
probability weights for the corresponding types as

With this setup and the random dynamics introduced earlier, each B-matrix

contains all the information about the edges from all the states at one moment of

time to the states at the next one. For example, B12 contains the information about

all edges from the single state with S

Both C1 and C3 have rows containing only zeros, except for two randomly

chosen positions where there are ones instead (these are the edges which connect to

states with higher entropy one unit of time later), and C2 is a column of zeros with

two randomly chosen ones instead (these are the edges which connect to states with

lower entropy one unit of time later).

7. Modeling the combinatorial multiverse as a probability space

Now when we have specified the dynamics of the model, i.e., decided which

paths (universes) can occur, it is time to attribute to each such path its probability

weight so that the multiverse becomes a probability space. Following the tradition

in statistical mechanics, I will frequently make use of un-normalized probabilities.

This means that summing up all (un-normalized) probabilities will give the “state

sum,” which in general is not equal to one. To obtain the usual probabilities, one has

to divide by the state sum. This may seem unnatural at first but turns out to be very

practical in situations where only the relative sizes of the probabilities are needed.
