Suppose  your  business  just  purchased  a  $100,000  asset  that  has  a  3-year  useful  life,  and  falls  into

3-year class of assets. Using the SL method, the depreciation expense each year for the next 3 years

would be:

Year

Recovery Rate

Unadjusted Basis

Depreciation Expense

Accumulated Depreciation

$100,000

Note that the book value or basis of the asset (acquisition cost – accumulated depreciation) would

be $0 after it has been fully depreciated at the end of 4 years. Because of the half-year convention, it

takes 4 years to depreciate the asset, even though it falls into the 3-year classification.

Depreciation expense for the same asset using the MACRS method would be calculated as:

Year

Recovery Rate

Unadjusted Basis

Depreciation Expense

Accumulated Depreciation

Note again that the depreciation expense using MACRS is higher in the early years and lower in later

years than with the SL method and that the book value after 4 years is again zero. Businesses often

use MACRS for tax purposes and SL for profit reporting. Can you think of any reasons why?

Some businesses that invest small amounts in capital assets are allowed to deduct up to $1,000,000

of the cost of acquired depreciable property as a current expenditure instead of a capital expenditure.

This is known as direct expensing, and is available only to businesses that don’t make large capital

purchases  each  year.  The  allowable  expensing  amount  is  reduced  by  one  dollar  for  each  dollar  of

capital investment expenditure over $2,500,000 during the year. Other restrictions also apply.
