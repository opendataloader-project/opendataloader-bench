In the Philippines, of the returning Filipino migrant workers in 2020, 55 percent
earned  a  monthly  income  of  between  PHP20,000  and  PHP50,000,  and  19
percent  earned  between  PHP5000  and  PHP20,000.  Before  their  return,  50
percent reported remitting amounts ranging from PHP10,000 to PHP20,000
(US$200  to  US$400)  monthly.  It  is  highly  unlikely  that  the  families  of  these
migrant  workers  would  have  savings  to  rely  on  after  they  lost  their  jobs.
Additionally,  83  percent  of  these  workers  were  still  unemployed  after  three
months, resulting in a 60 percent drop in household income for 48 percent of
the returned migrant workers.
