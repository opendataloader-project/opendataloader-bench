Probability, Combinatorics and Control

between this and the fact that the development of the underlying wave function for
the whole universe is unique.

Summarizing:
Definition 1. A universe U is a chain of states (one state Ut for each moment of

time t), with the property that the transition between adjacent states is always
possible.

Definition 2. A multiverse M is the set of all possible universes U in the sense of

Definition 1 together with a probability measure on this set.

It may of course be said that quantum mechanics should allow for transitions
between all kinds of states, although the probability for most such transitions may be
extremely small. In this extremely simplified treatment, I will assume that for a given
state at a given moment of time t, the dynamical laws will only permit transitions to a
very limited number of states at the previous and next moments, which will make the
probabilistic part of the investigation particularly simple. However, modifications are
called for near the endpoints (the Big Bang and the Big Crunch); see Section 5.

As it stands, the model presented so far is too simple to generate any results. In
fact, there are no observable differences at all between the states, which mean that
there are no measurable variables which could be related to the (so far non-
specified) dynamics.

There are of course many different variables which we can choose to enrich this

structure, and which ones to choose must depend on what properties we want to
explain. For explaining the second law of thermodynamics, the obvious choice is the
entropy.

4. Entropy

According to Boltzmann, the total entropy of a certain macro-state at a certain

time is given by

or inversely

¼

kB ln Ω,

Ω

¼

W S, with W

e1=kB,

¼

(2)

(3)

where Ω denotes the number of corresponding micro-states and kB is

Boltzmann’s constant.

This formula was from the beginning derived for simple cases, like an ideal gas.
Nevertheless, it does represent a kind of universal truth in statistical mechanics: the
number of possible micro-states corresponding to a given macro-state grows expo-
nentially with the entropy. Although there are many complications when one tries
to consider the entropy of the universe as a whole, I will still take it as the starting
point for the discussion that the entropy (at a given time t) is an exponential
function of the total entropy as in (3). A more difficult question is if and how the
constant W may vary with time, but for the purpose of the present paper, I will
simply let it be constant.

One may of course argue that this can only be true when the universe is still
quite ordered and the entropy is very far from reaching its maximum. But this is
certainly what the situation is like in our universe today, and according to the
computations in [10, 11], it would take an almost incredibly long time to reach such
a state of maximal entropy. Thus, it will in the following be taken for granted that
this time is much longer than the life-span of our universe.

5. The dynamics

The next step is to construct a model for the dynamics. The idea, which essen-

tially goes back to Boltzmann (see [12]), is that any given macro-state at any given

time is extremely likely to develop into a state with higher entropy at the next

moment of time, simply because there are so many more states with higher entropy

than with lower entropy (compare with (3)). The problem with this in the present

situation, however, is that this way of thinking in fact presupposes a preferred

direction of time. Otherwise, given that the dynamical laws are time symmetric,

why can we not similarly argue that the entropy should also grow when we go

backward in time? (compare [9]).

There have been many attempts to avoid this problem by looking for defects in

the symmetries. But my conclusion here is that we must actually accept Boltzmann’s

argument in both directions of time and hence we are led to the following:

Principle 1. At every moment of time t and for every state with entropy S, there

are very many “accessible states” with higher entropy, both at the previous moment

of time t

1 and at the next one t

1. On the other hand, the chance for finding

such accessible states with lower entropy, both at times t

1 and t

1, is extremely

This principle also implies a shift of perspective in the search for time’s arrow.

Rather than trying to find the reason for the asymmetry, we must concentrate on

understanding why we cannot observe the symmetric structure of the multiverse as

small.

a whole.

As still one more simplification, let us assume that the entropy can only change

by

1 during each unit of time. This assumption, however, has to be modified near

the endpoints (BB and BC) for the following reason: it is a very important aspect of

�

this approach to assume that physics during the first and last moments is very

different from the rest of the time, since at these moments quantum phenomena

can be expected to become global. To model this in a simple way, we can split the

life-span of our multiverse up into three parts:

T0,

T1

Here the first and last parts may be called “the extreme phases,” which are

characterized by the property that transition between very different states can be

possible. During the “normal phase” in between on the other hand, physics is

supposed to behave more or less as we are used to.

6. Modeling the dynamics

To construct a miniature multiverse for computational purposes, one can pro-

ceed as follows: first of all, in the very small multiverses studied here, the extreme

phases will only last for one single unit of time. Also, for ease of notation, let us put

m, so that the moments of time can in this context be denoted as

The dynamics is specified by randomly choosing for each state at time t with

entropy S, K edges to states at time t

states at time t

equal to 2. These random choices are in practice carried out by the random number
