Current Situation: 2001-2019

Filipino  women  are  still  very  much  a  minority  in  the  formal
political sphere. It can also be observed that in executive positions such
as the cabinet, few women are appointed, especially during President
Fidel  Ramos’s  time,  compared  to  Cory  Aquino’s  administration
