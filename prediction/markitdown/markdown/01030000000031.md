equal zero when certain parameters tend to infinity in some well-defined way.

However, it is worthwhile at this stage to note their implications for cosmology.
The strong broken symmetry in Definition 5 actually means that a monotonic
behavior of the entropy is far more probable than a non-monotonic one. In the case
of a weak broken symmetry, this is not necessarily so; it could very well be that the
most probable scenario would be high entropy at both ends. Thus, this is definitely a
weaker statement, but it can nevertheless be argued that it can be used to explain
the time asymmetry that we observe, referring to a kind of anthropic principle: it is
an obvious observational fact that we live in a universe with low entropy at at least
one end. If the statement in Definition 4 is fulfilled, then clearly among such
scenarios, the monotonic ones (LH and HL) are the by far most probable ones.
Thus, since universes with high entropy at both ends would seem to be quite
uninhabitable, one can argue that given the existence of an observer, then with
almost certainty he must live in a universe with monotonic entropy.

Summing up, both limits above can be used to argue in favor of time asymmetry.
Nevertheless, at least to the mind of the author, the strong broken symmetry is the
preferable one. This alternative will be further studied in Section 9.

8. Numerical computations in the combinatorial multiverse

With the setup in Sections 6 and 7, we can now use Mathematica or MATLAB to
generate instances of the combinatorial multiverse for small values of m and W and
then compute the corresponding probability weights PLL, PLH, PHL and PHH. It is
important to note that the matrices here can be treated as sparse, rather than as full
matrices, which make the computations considerably faster.

In particular, in the case m

2 in Section 6 and with a randomly generated
dynamics which is manifested by an adjacency matrix A, we can compute the
power A4 and read of the first row, which contains all the information we need
about the paths from the state at t

may behave quite differently.

9. Can the dynamics be modified to generate a strong broken symmetry?

Obviously, the above model represents an extreme simplification. But from the

point of view of the author, most of the simplifications can be said to be rather

harmless for the purpose of explaining time’s arrow.

However, there is one assumption which is somewhat problematic in the

dynamics that we have discussed so far: the model can be said to exhibit a kind of

Markov property in the sense that the probability for the entropy to go up or down

at a certain step is completely independent of the prehistory of the state; it just

depends on the state itself. This does not appear to be what is happening in our own

universe: for instance, light emitted from (more or less) pointlike sources like stars

continues to spread out concentrically for billions of years, and in this way it

preserves a memory of the prehistory for a very long time.

A very interesting research project is therefore to try to find better models which

do not exhibit this property. We can, for instance, attempt to construct models

where the behavior of the entropy not only depends on the previous (or following)

step but on a larger part of the prehistory (or post-history). As a particularly simple

example one could let the probabilities for an increase (or decrease) of the entropy

at a certain step, depend not only on the previous and following step but on the two

previous (and following) steps. In fact, such dynamics would not only be more

realistic but would in general also have a much better chance to exhibit a strong

broken time symmetry.

I will now briefly discuss an example of such a modified model. In Section 6 it

was noted that the number of paths between a state i at time

m and another state j

at time m can be computed using the adjacency matrix A as

This sum can now be modified by introducing various weights depending on the

path. An example of such a weight can be constructed as follows: given a path U
