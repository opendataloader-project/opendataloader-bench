## Closure

Closure  refers  to  our  mind  completing  missing  portions  of  a design.  There  must  be  enough  parts  available  for  the  image to be 'filled in'; if the image is too abstract, there are minimal reference points for the mind to complete it. See Figure 4.4 4 for an example of how our mind automatically imagine a line connecting the 2 broken ones.
