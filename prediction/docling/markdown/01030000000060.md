Applications  of  wood  pellets  in  Japan  include  power  generation,  boilers,  stoves, agriculture use, and others. Although the trade statistics do not specify the usage of the imported wood pellets, according to the Japan Wood Pellet Association (JPA), most are used for power generation.

The price of domestic wood pellets for power generation has a wide range. According to a survey of domestic wood pellet manufacturers undertaken by JPA in 2020, the average price of domestic wood pellets for power generation is around 14,000~29,000 ¥/tonne, while according to the Trade Statistics of Japan, the average cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price of imported wood pellets is around 18,000 ¥/tonne in 2020 (Figure 4.9).
