# Growth and the Creation of Life

One of the characteristics of living things is the ability to replicate and passon genetic information to the next generation. Cell division in individual bacteria and archaea usually occurs by binary fission. Mitochondria and chloroplasts also replicate by binary fission, which is evidence of the evolutionary relationship between these organelles and prokaryotes.

Cell division in eukaryotes is more complex. It requires the cell to manage acomplicated process of duplicating the nucleus, other organelles, and multiple linear chromosomes. It is controlled in the cell cycle, which is divided into three parts: interphase, mitosis, and cytokinesis. We spilt those further for ease of study. Let’s start with interphase, which is broken into three stages. In the first growth phase (G1),the cell grows and prepares to duplicate its DNA. In the synthesis phase (S), the chromosomes are replicated. In the second growth phase (G2), the cell prepares to divide.
