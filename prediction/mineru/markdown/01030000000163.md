# As a developer:

· Do careful mapping of seagrass in potential areas for development · Avoid dredging and filling · Learn about existing regulations

· Diminish fertilizer use (use soaking, rain gardens,and native plants instead) · Dispose of pet waste properly · Keep seagrass in mind during construction (for example,build high docks with grating instead of planks)
