# 4.1 Introduction

The pressure drop in a fluid in motion is examined. For a flow in a pipe with a circular cross section of diameter $D$ (meter), the Reynolds number, $R e ,$ is given by

$$
R e = \frac { D v } { \nu } ,
$$

in which $v$ $( m / s )$ is the average flow velocity and $\nu$ $( m ^ { 2 } / s )$ is the viscosity of the fluid. The flow is called laminar if $R e < 2 1 0 0$ (low flow velocity) and turbulent if $R e > 3 0 0 0$ . For $2 1 0 0 \leq R e \leq 3 0 0 0 ,$ the flow is neither laminar nor turbulent.

For turbulent flows, the pressure drop between inflow and outflow is given by

$$
P _ { \mathrm { o u t } } - P _ { \mathrm { i n } } = { \frac { \rho w L v ^ { 2 } } { 2 g D } } ,
$$

in which $w$ is a friction coefficient, $\rho$ $( k g / m ^ { 3 } )$ is the fluid density, $L \ ( m )$ is the length and $g \left( m / s ^ { 2 } \right)$ is the acceleration of gravity. If the fluid contains particles (sand, paper fibers), then the friction coefficient $w$ satisfies the equation

$$
\frac { 1 } { \sqrt { w } } = \frac { \ln ( R e \sqrt { w } ) + 1 4 - \frac { 5 . 6 } { k } } { k } ,
$$

in which $k$ is a parameter known from experiments.

In this chapter, numerical methods will be discussed that can be used to determine $w$ if the values of $R e$ and $k$ are known.

# 4.2 Definitions

In this chapter, various iterative methods will be considered to solve nonlinear equations of the form $f ( p ) = 0$ . The point $p$ is called a zero of the function $f ,$ or a root of the equation $f ( x ) = 0$ . First, some useful definitions and concepts are introduced.

# Convergence

Each numerical method generates a sequence $\{ p _ { n } \} = p _ { 0 } , p _ { 1 } , p _ { 2 } , . . .$ which should converge to $p$ : $\scriptstyle \operatorname* { l i m } _ { n \to \infty } p _ { n } = p $ Assume that the sequence indeed converges, with $p _ { n } \neq p$ for all $n$ . If there exist positive constants $\lambda$ and $\alpha$ satisfying

$$
\operatorname* { l i m } _ { n \to \infty } { \frac { | p - p _ { n + 1 } | } { | p - p _ { n } | ^ { \alpha } } } = \lambda ,
$$
