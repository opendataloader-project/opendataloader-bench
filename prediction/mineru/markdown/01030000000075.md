2020 and 2021, and, for approximately half of AMS, working hours lost were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 (Figure 1.3). The disruptions in global supply chains because of travel and transport restrictions hit some AMS particularly hard because of supply needs from other countries.

Despite these tremendous job losses, many countries also experienced labour shortages due to previously unprecedented demand for certain products, such as rubber gloves in Malaysia and for fishery products in Thailand. The return of migrant workers to their home countries contributed to significant labour shortages (Lee and David, 2021; Sriring and Staporncharnchai, 2021).4 COVID-related movement restrictions caused many workers to withdraw from the labour force (especially women) and labour force participation rates declined in most countries.5 This was the case for Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam (Figure 1.4). According to the ILO (2021c), female employment in AMS in 2020 was 3.9 percent lower than the expected level, which is markedly less than the 2.7 percent figure for male employment.6 The impact of the pandemic on employment is evident in lower labour force participation, lower working hours, and higher unemployment rates in most countries (Figure 1.5).
