# Closure

Closure refers to our mind completing missing portions of a design. There must be enough parts available for the image to be “filled in”; if the image is too abstract, there are minimal reference points for the mind to complete it. See Figure 4.44 for an example of how our mind automatically imagine a line connecting the 2 broken ones.
