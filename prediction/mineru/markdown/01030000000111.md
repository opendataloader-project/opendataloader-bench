# 7. THEORY

Two types of vortices are distinguished in the dynamics of the motion: forced and free vortices. The forced vortex is caused by external forces on the fluid, such as the impeller of a pump, and the free vortex naturally occurs in the flow and can be observed in a drain or in the atmosphere of a tornado.

# 7.1. FREE VORTEX

A free vortex is formed when water flows out of a vessel through a central hole in the base (Figure 8.2). The degree of the rotation depends on the initial disturbance. In a free cylindrical vortex, the velocity varies inversely with the distance from the axis of rotation (Figure 8.3).

$$
\textstyle v = { \frac { k } { r } }
$$

The equation governing the surface profile is derived from the Bernoulli’s theorem:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \frac { v ^ { 2 } } { 2 g } + z = C } \end{array}
$$

Substituting Equation (1) into (2) will give a new expression:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \frac { k ^ { 2 } } { 2 g r ^ { 2 } } + z = C } \end{array}
$$
