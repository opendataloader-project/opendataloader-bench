What’s unique about the growth of Alligator Gars is their fast growth in the first years of life followed by slower growth (Figure 8.6; Figure 8.7). Juvenile Alligator Gars quickly transition to fish-eating habits (Butler et al. 2018). A fish diet means the juveniles grow at $4 { \cdot } 5 \mathrm { m m }$ per day in the first three months of life, so that by the end of the first growing season they may reach 1.5 to 2 feet in length $( \mathord { \sim } 4 0 \mathord { - } 7 0 \mathrm { c m } )$ and 8–10 pounds in weight (Sakaris et al. 2019). Despite their fast growth, young Alligator Gars are preyed upon by many larger fish.
