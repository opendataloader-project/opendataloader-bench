# IMPLEMENTATION

Locally, we implemented a quick and free solution that reflects the constraints of system capabilities, no financial support, and a local directive to vet every course to be tagged. Based on what was feasible in the short term and conversations with key stakeholders (i.e., registrar, early OER adopters, curriculum coordinators, student representatives, and the campus store), we incorporated an “educational resources cost” option into an existing “course attribute” drop-down menu under the system’s advanced search options.
