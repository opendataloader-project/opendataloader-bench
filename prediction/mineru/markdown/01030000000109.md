the jet velocity can be assumed to remain constant. Therefore, the horizontal distance traveled by jet $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { x } )$ in time (t) is equal to:

$$
x = v . t
$$

The vertical component of the trajectory of the jet will have a constant acceleration downward due to the force of gravity. Therefore, at any time, t, the y-position of the jet may be calculated as:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { y = { \frac { 1 } { 2 } } g t ^ { 2 } } \end{array}
$$

Rearranging Equation (8) gives:

$$
t = ( \frac { 2 y } { g } ) ^ { 0 . 5 }
$$

Substitution of $\mathrm { \Delta t }$ and $\nu$ from Equations 9 and 2 into Equation 7 results in:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { x = C _ { v } \sqrt { 2 g h } ( \frac { 2 y } { g } ) ^ { 0 . 5 } } \end{array}
$$

Equations (10) can be rearranged to find $C _ { \mathbf { V } }$ :

$$
\begin{array} { r } { C _ { v } = \frac { x } { 2 \sqrt { y h } } } \end{array}
$$

Therefore, for steady flow conditions (i.e., constant h in the head tank), the value of $C _ { \mathbf { V } }$ can be determined from the $\mathbf { X }$ , y coordinates of the jet trajectory. A graph of $x$ plotted against $\sqrt { y h }$ will have a slope of $2 C _ { \mathrm { v } }$ .

# 7.2. DETERMINATION OF THE COEFFICIENT OF DISCHARGE

If $C _ { \mathrm { d } }$ is assumed to be constant, then a graph of $Q$ plotted against $\sqrt { h }$ (Equation 6) will be linear, and the slope of this graph will be:

$$
s = C _ { d } A _ { o } \sqrt { 2 g }
$$
