the jet velocity can be assumed to remain constant. Therefore, the horizontal distance traveled by jet (x) in time (t) is equal to:

$$x = v.t$$
 (7)

The vertical component of the trajectory of the jet will have a constant acceleration downward due to the force of gravity. Therefore, at any time, t, the y-position of the jet may be calculated as:

$$y = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \tag{8}$$

Rearranging Equation (8) gives:

$$t = \left(\frac{2y}{g}\right)^{0.5} \tag{9}$$

Substitution of t and *v* from Equations 9 and 2 into Equation 7 results in:

$$x = C_v \sqrt{2gh} \left(\frac{2y}{g}\right)^{0.5} \tag{10}$$

Equations (10) can be rearranged to find *C*v:

$$C_v = \frac{x}{2\sqrt{yh}} \qquad (11)$$

Therefore, for steady flow conditions (i.e., constant h in the head tank), the value of *C*v can be determined from the x, y coordinates of the jet trajectory. A graph of *x* plotted against will have a slope of 2*C*v*.* 

## **7.2. DETERMINATION OF THE COEFFICIENT OF DISCHARGE**

If *C*d is assumed to be constant, then a graph of *Q* plotted against (Equation 6) will be linear, and the slope of this graph will be:

$$s = C_d A_o \sqrt{2g} \qquad (12)$$
