To reiterate, this study's main econometric results reveal a negative effect on sinking a putt when the typical golfer is putting for birdie, and a positive effect on putting for bogey. Consistent with the previous graphs, these numerical results suggest that the typical professional golfer is more likely to sink a put for bogey and less likely to sink the putt for birdie (i.e., the typical golfer is indeed loss averse).<sup>10</sup>

## **ARE CIGARETTE SMOKERS HYPERBOLIC TIME DISCOUNTERS?**

Recall from Chapter 4 the distinction between time-consistent exponential time discounters (*Homo economicus*) and potentially time-inconsistent hyperbolic discounters (*Homo sapiens*). The discounting time paths for exponential versus hyperbolic discounting looked like this:

<sup>10.</sup> A negative effect associated with putting for double bogey suggests that the typical golfer suppresses his inclination for loss aversion when putting for a score worse than bogey.
